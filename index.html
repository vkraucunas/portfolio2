								<h3><strong>My Career Transition</strong></h3>
								<p>
									After reaching my limit of answering phones and unjamming copy machines as an administrative assistant, I enrolled in the Galvanize Full Stack Immersive program. While in the program, I built my confidence in solving problems with code, worked with groups, and done one of my favorite things: CREATE!
								</p>
								<h3><strong>What I Add to a Team</strong></h3>
								<p>
									As a developer, I have front-end leanings, but value the full stack. My experience to this point has been focused on web development, and most of my professional work has been done in React.js.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Strong communication skills and positive attitude make me fun to know and work with. I strive to be always adding value, even if it is as simple as adding more emojis to the company Slack team.</li>
									<li>Dedication to documentation and sharing knowledge across teams.</li>
									<li>Familiarity with best practices of how to bring junior talent into a development team.</li>
									<li>Excitement to accept challenges and progressively solve more difficult problems over time.</li>
									<li>User-focused development; the experience of the user drives my work. I will speak up especially about UI accessibility.</li>
									<li>Always looking for ways to improve my code contributions.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3><strong>Outside of Work</strong></h3>
								<p>
									In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my pets, playing video games, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/flatlanderesque/">pinning</a>, and cooking.
