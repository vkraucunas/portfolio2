            <hr>
            <p>After reaching my limit of answering phones and unjamming copy machines as an administrative assistant, I enrolled in the Galvanize Full Stack Immersive program. While in the program, I have been able to build my confidence in solving problems with code, work with groups, and do one of my favorite things: <span>CREATE!</span></p>
            <p>As a developer, I definitely have some front-end leanings, but value the process of building a whole application from drawing an entity relationship diagram for the database to finalizing design. I'm highly organized and so is my code and my approach to coding.</p>
            <p>Have doubts about how much someone can learn in 6 months? <a href="http://vkraucunas.github.io/portfolio/">Here is the portfolio site I put together as pre-work for Galvanize.</a></p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my dogs and cat, playing video games, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/flatlanderesque/">pinning</a>, and cooking.</p>
